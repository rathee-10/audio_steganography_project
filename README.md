# audio_steganography_project

Audio Steganography tool: 
An Audio Steganography Tool developed using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique for embedding hidden messages in audio files.

Features: 
1) LSB-Based Steganography: Embeds hidden messages in audio files with minimal impact on audio quality.
2) Message Embedding and Extraction: Supports both functionalities with an intuitive process flow.
3) Data Integrity: Maintains high audio quality and preserves the original message integrity.

Tech Stack used: 
Programming Language: Java
File Manipulation: Binary file handling for accurate audio data processing
Audio Processing Libraries: Utilized Java libraries for efficient audio handlingreserves the original message integrity.
